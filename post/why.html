		<h1>Why</h1>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8">video</a> of Richard Feynman answering a question of "Why".
If you relate to this, being young and asking your parents "Why" questions, with the only answer I started 
getting was to search it up online because its easier to not answer a "Why" question than to keep answering 
deeper and deeper "Why" questions. </p>
<p>How much knowledge can we gain without there being any knowledge left to uncover. Discovering sub-atomic 
particles smaller than atoms, then discovering particles even smaller than sub-atomic particles. Does this 
go on forever? Can we just keep looking for smaller and smaller particles or does it end? </p>
<p>What happens is that you ask a "Why" question but the answer one might give to you does not satisfy you, so 
you continue to ask even deeper "Why" questions. This does seem to go on forever, or does it?</p>
